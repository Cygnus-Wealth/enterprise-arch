# Data Models Domain

## Domain Overview

The Data Models domain serves as the foundational contract layer for the entire CygnusWealth ecosystem. It defines the unified data structures that ensure consistency and clear communication between all domains.

## Core Responsibilities

### Primary Functions
1. **Unified Data Structures**: Define all shared data models across the system
2. **Domain Contracts**: Establish interfaces between domains
3. **Data Validation**: Provide validation rules and constraints
4. **Standardization**: Ensure consistent data representation
5. **Versioning**: Manage data model evolution

### Domain Boundaries
- **Owns**: All shared data definitions, validation rules, and constants
- **Does NOT Own**: Business logic, data fetching, UI components, persistence

## Core Data Models

### Portfolio Models
- **Portfolio**: Complete aggregated view of user's assets
- **Asset**: Individual asset representation (crypto, stocks, NFTs)
- **Balance**: Quantity and formatting information
- **Value**: Monetary valuation with currency and timestamp

### Transaction Models
- **Transaction**: Unified transaction representation across all sources
- **Transaction Types**: Transfer, swap, deposit, withdrawal, mint, burn, trade
- **Transaction Status**: Pending, confirmed, failed, cancelled
- **Transaction Metadata**: Additional context and source-specific data

### Market Data Models
- **Market Data**: Current price and market statistics
- **Price History**: Historical price points for charting
- **Volume Data**: Trading volume across timeframes
- **Market Metrics**: Market cap, circulating supply, price changes

### Integration Models
- **Integration Source**: Identifies data origin (EVM, Solana, Robinhood, etc.)
- **Connection State**: Status of integration connections
- **Sync Status**: Data freshness and last update times
- **Error States**: Standardized error representations

### Chain and Network Models
- **Chain Identity**: Blockchain identifiers and metadata
- **Network Configuration**: RPC endpoints and chain parameters
- **Token Standards**: ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155, SPL tokens
- **Address Formats**: Chain-specific address representations

## Data Standardization Principles

### Unified Representation
- All monetary values use consistent decimal precision
- Timestamps are ISO 8601 formatted
- Addresses are checksummed where applicable
- Token amounts account for decimals

### Cross-Domain Consistency
- Same asset has identical structure regardless of source
- Transaction format unified across CEX and DEX sources
- Error codes standardized across all integrations
- Status enums consistent throughout system

### Data Validation Rules
- Address format validation per chain
- Numeric bounds checking for amounts
- Required field enforcement
- Referential integrity between related models

## Version Management

### Backward Compatibility
- New fields are optional by default
- Deprecation notices before removal
- Migration paths for breaking changes
- Version flags for conditional handling

### Schema Evolution
- Semantic versioning for model changes
- Documentation of all changes
- Automated migration tooling
- Compatibility testing across domains

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
- Minimal data structure nesting
- Efficient serialization formats
- Lazy loading for heavy fields
- Compression for large datasets

### Caching Guidelines
- Immutable data can be cached indefinitely
- Market data requires TTL-based caching
- Balance data needs invalidation on updates
- Transaction history can be incrementally cached

## Security Principles

### Data Sanitization
- Input validation on all external data
- XSS prevention in string fields
- SQL injection prevention in queries
- Integer overflow protection

### Sensitive Data Handling
- No private keys in data models
- API keys encrypted at rest
- Personal information minimized
- Audit trails for data access

## Integration Guidelines

### Using Data Models
- Import only required models
- Validate data at domain boundaries
- Transform external data immediately
- Maintain type safety throughout

### Extending Models
- Domain-specific extensions allowed locally
- Core models remain immutable
- Extensions documented clearly
- No breaking changes to contracts

## Testing Requirements

### Model Validation
- Unit tests for all validators
- Property-based testing for generators
- Edge case coverage
- Cross-domain integration tests

### Contract Testing
- Consumer-driven contract tests
- Breaking change detection
- Version compatibility checks
- Performance regression tests

## Documentation Standards

### Model Documentation
- Purpose and usage for each model
- Field descriptions and constraints
- Example data for clarity
- Relationship diagrams

### Change Documentation
- Changelog for all modifications
- Migration guides for updates
- Deprecation schedules
