# Wallet Integration System

## Bounded Context Overview

The Wallet Integration System manages connections to cryptocurrency wallets and wallet providers. It handles the complexity of different wallet standards, connection protocols, and session management, providing a unified interface for wallet interactions across all supported chains.

**For context**: This bounded context specification is part of the Integration Domain. See the [Integration Domain README](../README.md) for strategic guidance and domain-level patterns.

## Core Responsibilities

### Primary Functions
1. **Wallet Connection Management**: Connect to MetaMask, Phantom, Rabby, and other wallets
2. **Session Persistence**: Maintain wallet connection state across sessions
3. **Provider Abstraction**: Abstract different wallet provider APIs
4. **Multi-Wallet Support**: Handle multiple connected wallets simultaneously
5. **Chain Switching**: Coordinate chain switching across wallets
6. **Address Discovery**: Retrieve connected addresses from wallets
7. **Connection Events**: Emit events for connection state changes

### Domain Boundaries
- **Owns**: Wallet provider connections, session management, provider abstraction
- **Does NOT Own**: Transaction signing, private keys, blockchain data fetching, portfolio aggregation

## Supported Wallets

### EVM Wallets
- MetaMask
- Rabby
- WalletConnect
- Coinbase Wallet
- Trust Wallet
- Frame

### Solana Wallets
- Phantom
- Solflare
- Backpack
- Glow

### Multi-Chain Wallets
- Exodus
- Atomic Wallet
- Math Wallet

## Architecture Principles

### Provider Management
- Detect available wallet providers
- Handle multiple provider instances
- Graceful fallback when providers unavailable
- Provider conflict resolution

### Connection Flow
1. **Detection**: Identify available wallet providers
2. **Selection**: User chooses wallet to connect
3. **Authorization**: Request connection permission
4. **Session**: Establish and maintain session
5. **Monitoring**: Track connection state changes

### Session Handling
- Persist connections across page refreshes
- Restore previous sessions on return
- Handle session expiration
- Clean disconnection

## Integration Patterns

### Service Interface
The system exposes services for wallet management:

#### Connection Service
- Detect available wallets
- Initiate wallet connections
- Disconnect wallets
- Switch between wallets

#### Session Service
- Store connection state
- Restore previous sessions
- Monitor session health
- Handle reconnection

#### Address Service
- Get connected addresses
- Monitor address changes
- Support multi-account wallets
- Handle account switching

### Event System
- Wallet connected
- Wallet disconnected
- Account changed
- Chain changed
- Session expired

## Wallet Standards

### EIP-1193 (EVM)
- Standard Ethereum provider interface
- Request/response pattern
- Event subscription support
- Error handling

### Wallet Standard (Solana)
- Solana wallet adapter protocol
- Connection lifecycle
- Transaction preparation
- Message signing preparation

### WalletConnect Protocol
- QR code connections
- Mobile wallet support
- Deep linking
- Session management

## Security Considerations

### Read-Only Operations
- Never request private keys
- No transaction signing capabilities
- Only read public addresses
- No seed phrase handling

### Permission Management
- Request minimal permissions
- Clear permission explanations
- Revocable connections
- Audit connection requests

### Provider Security
- Validate provider sources
- Check provider integrity
- Prevent provider spoofing
- Secure communication

## Error Handling

### Common Scenarios
- User rejects connection
- Wallet locked
- Provider not found
- Network mismatch
- Session expired
- Multiple wallet conflicts

### Recovery Strategies
1. **Connection Rejection**: Clear messaging and retry option
2. **Locked Wallet**: Prompt user to unlock
3. **Missing Provider**: Suggest wallet installation
4. **Network Issues**: Guide network switching
5. **Session Recovery**: Automatic reconnection attempts

## State Management

### Connection State
- Not connected
- Connecting
- Connected
- Disconnecting
- Error

### Session Data
- Wallet type
- Connected addresses
- Active chain
- Connection timestamp
- Last activity

### Multi-Wallet Coordination
- Track multiple connections
- Primary wallet designation
- Wallet switching logic
- Conflict resolution

## Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage Areas
- Connection flow testing
- Multi-wallet scenarios
- Session persistence
- Error handling
- Event emission
- Provider mocking

### Integration Testing
- Real wallet connections (testnet)
- Multi-chain switching
- Session restoration
- Disconnection flows

## Configuration

### Configurable Parameters
- Supported wallet list
- Connection timeout
- Session duration
- Retry attempts
- Auto-connect preferences

### Network Configuration
- Supported chains per wallet
- Default networks
- Custom RPC endpoints
- Network switching rules

## Performance Considerations

### Connection Optimization
- Lazy loading of wallet SDKs
- Connection caching
- Efficient provider detection
- Minimal re-renders

### Memory Management
- Clean up unused connections
- Limit stored session data
- Efficient event listeners
- Provider instance management

## Relationship with Other Contexts

### Provides Addresses To
- **evm-integration**: Ethereum addresses to monitor
- **sol-integration**: Solana addresses to monitor
- **portfolio-aggregation**: List of user's addresses

### Does Not
- Fetch blockchain data (handled by integration contexts)
- Aggregate portfolio data (handled by portfolio-aggregation)
- Sign transactions (out of scope - read-only)

## Future Enhancements

- Hardware wallet support
- Social wallet integration
- Account abstraction support
- Multi-signature wallet handling
- Mobile wallet deep linking
- Wallet analytics and insights
