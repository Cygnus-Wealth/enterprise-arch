# Integration Domain

## Overview

The Integration Domain is responsible for all external data acquisition and connection management. It provides read-only access to various blockchain networks and traditional finance platforms, transforming external data into the unified CygnusWealth data model.

## Strategic Importance

This domain serves as the data acquisition layer for the entire system, abstracting away the complexities of different APIs, blockchain RPCs, and external services. It ensures that the rest of the system can work with consistent, normalized data regardless of the source.

## Bounded Contexts

### 1. Wallet Integration System
- **Responsibility**: Wallet connections and provider management
- **Repository**: `wallet-integration-system`
- **Documentation**: [Wallet Integration System Context](./bounded-contexts/wallet-integration-system.md)

### 2. EVM Integration
- **Responsibility**: Ethereum and EVM-compatible blockchain data
- **Repository**: `evm-integration`
- **Documentation**: [EVM Integration Context](./bounded-contexts/evm-integration.md)

### 3. Solana Integration
- **Responsibility**: Solana blockchain data and SPL tokens
- **Repository**: `sol-integration`
- **Documentation**: [Solana Integration Context](./bounded-contexts/sol-integration.md)

### 4. Robinhood Integration
- **Responsibility**: Traditional finance brokerage data
- **Repository**: `robinhood-integration`
- **Documentation**: [Robinhood Integration Context](./bounded-contexts/robinhood-integration.md)

## Domain Principles

### 1. Read-Only Operations
All integrations are strictly read-only. This domain never:
- Handles private keys
- Signs transactions
- Modifies external state
- Stores credentials permanently

### 2. Data Normalization
Every integration must:
- Transform external data to unified data models
- Maintain consistent error formats
- Provide standardized status codes
- Use common units and formats

### 3. Resilience Patterns
All integrations implement:
- Circuit breakers for failing endpoints
- Automatic failover to backup sources
- Exponential backoff for rate limiting
- Graceful degradation when sources unavailable

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Intelligent caching strategies per data type
- Request batching where supported
- Connection pooling for efficiency
- Parallel fetching when possible

## Common Capabilities

### Shared Patterns
All integration contexts share these patterns:
- **Connection Management**: Handle connections to external sources
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect and manage API rate limits
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error reporting and recovery
- **Data Transformation**: Convert to unified data models
- **Caching**: Smart caching based on data volatility

### Cross-Context Coordination
While each context is independent, they coordinate through:
- Shared data model definitions
- Common error handling patterns
- Consistent service interfaces
- Unified configuration approach

## Technical Standards

### Service Interface Pattern
Each integration exposes a consistent service interface:
- Balance fetching services
- Transaction history services
- Real-time monitoring capabilities
- Health check endpoints

### Configuration Management
- Environment-specific RPC endpoints
- API keys and authentication
- Rate limit configurations
- Cache TTL settings

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for data transformation
- Integration tests with mock services
- End-to-end tests with test networks
- Performance benchmarks

## Security Considerations

### Data Security
- No storage of private keys or seeds
- Encrypted API key storage
- Secure token management
- Data sanitization before processing

### Access Control
- Read-only permissions only
- Principle of least privilege
- Audit logging for all access
- Regular security reviews

## Future Expansion

### Planned Integrations
- Bitcoin and Lightning Network
- Additional CEX platforms (Coinbase, Kraken)
- DeFi protocol integrations
- Cross-chain bridges

### Enhancement Opportunities
- WebSocket subscriptions for real-time data
- Advanced caching strategies
- Machine learning for anomaly detection
- Predictive pre-fetching

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- `data-models`: For unified data structures

### External Dependencies
- Blockchain RPC providers
- Exchange APIs
- Price aggregator services
- Market data feeds

## Performance Metrics

### Service Level Objectives
- 99.5% availability per integration
- Sub-2 second response for balance queries
- 60%+ cache hit ratio
- Less than 1% error rate

### Monitoring
- Service health dashboards
- API response time tracking
- Cache effectiveness metrics
- Error rate monitoring

## Governance

### Domain Ownership
The Integration Domain team is responsible for:
- Maintaining integration reliability
- Adding new integrations
- Ensuring data quality
- Managing external API relationships

### Change Management
- New integrations require architecture review
- API changes need compatibility assessment
- Performance impacts must be measured
- Security review for new data sources
