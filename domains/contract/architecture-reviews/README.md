# Contract Domain - Architecture Reviews

This directory contains historical architectural reviews and assessments of the Contract Domain and its bounded contexts. These documents provide critical context for understanding architectural decisions, governance frameworks, and the evolution of domain principles.

## Purpose

Architecture reviews serve multiple purposes:

1. **Architectural Validation** - External review ensures alignment with enterprise architecture principles
2. **Decision Transparency** - Documents the rationale behind key architectural choices
3. **Governance Evolution** - Tracks how governance frameworks and processes were established
4. **Knowledge Preservation** - Maintains institutional knowledge about why certain patterns were adopted

## Review Process

The Contract Domain follows a structured review process:

1. **System Architect Response** - Bounded context architects respond to reviews with proposed solutions
2. **Domain Architect Assessment** - Domain architect evaluates responses and provides strategic guidance
3. **Implementation** - Approved changes are incorporated into architecture documentation
4. **Archive** - Completed review dialogues are preserved here for historical reference

### October 2025 - Data Models Foundational Review

**Status:** COMPLETE

This foundational review established critical architectural patterns for the data-models bounded context:

- **[SYSTEM_ARCHITECT_RESPONSE.md](./SYSTEM_ARCHITECT_RESPONSE.md)** - System architect's comprehensive response addressing build configuration, governance, documentation philosophy, and fitness functions
- **[DOMAIN_ARCHITECT_ASSESSMENT.md](./DOMAIN_ARCHITECT_ASSESSMENT.md)** - Domain architect's assessment approving governance framework and providing strategic guidance

**Key Decisions Established:**
- TypeScript enums as documented architectural exception
- JSDoc as architectural contract (not commentary)
- Four-tier contract stability model (Core/Standard/Extended/Experimental)
- RFC process for breaking changes
- Phased governance board approach
- Architectural fitness functions framework
- Roadmap to v1.0 with explicit criteria

**Impact:** These decisions form the foundation of the Contract Domain's governance model and are now embedded in the bounded context architecture documentation.

## Using These Documents

These archived reviews should be consulted when:

- Understanding the rationale behind current architectural patterns
- Proposing significant architectural changes
- Onboarding new architects to the domain
- Evaluating whether to revisit past decisions
- Writing RFCs that relate to established patterns

The decisions documented here have been incorporated into active architecture documentation, but these archives preserve the **why** behind the **what**.
