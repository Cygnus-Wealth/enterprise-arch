# Contract Domain

## Overview

The Contract Domain defines the shared language and data structures that enable communication between all domains in the CygnusWealth system. It serves as the foundational layer that ensures consistency, type safety, and clear contracts across domain boundaries.

## Strategic Importance

This domain represents the **Published Language** in DDD terms - a well-documented, stable, shared model that all other domains can depend upon. It's the glue that allows independent domains to communicate effectively while maintaining their autonomy.

## Bounded Contexts

### 1. Data Models
- **Responsibility**: Unified data structures and contracts
- **Repository**: `data-models`
- **Documentation**: [Data Models Context](./bounded-contexts/data-models.md)

## Domain Principles

### 1. Stability First
The contract domain prioritizes stability:
- Backward compatibility is mandatory
- Breaking changes require migration paths
- Semantic versioning enforced
- Deprecation cycles respected

### 2. Domain Neutrality
Contracts remain neutral to implementation:
- No business logic
- No domain-specific rules
- Pure data structures
- Technology agnostic

### 3. Ubiquitous Language
Establishes common vocabulary:
- Consistent naming conventions
- Clear, unambiguous definitions
- Well-documented fields
- Shared understanding

### 4. Type Safety
Ensures compile-time correctness:
- Strong typing throughout
- Validation rules included
- Runtime type checking
- Clear constraints

## Core Responsibilities

### Data Structure Definition
- **Portfolio Models**: Portfolio, Asset, Balance structures
- **Transaction Models**: Transaction types and statuses
- **Market Models**: Price, market data structures
- **Integration Models**: Source identifiers, connection states

### Contract Establishment
- **Service Interfaces**: Common service patterns
- **Event Definitions**: Domain event structures
- **Error Models**: Standardized error formats
- **Response Formats**: Consistent API responses

### Validation Rules
- **Field Validation**: Required fields, formats
- **Business Constraints**: Valid ranges, enums
- **Cross-field Rules**: Dependent validations
- **Consistency Checks**: Data integrity rules

## Data Categories

### Core Business Objects
Fundamental business entities:
- Portfolio representation
- Asset definitions
- Transaction records
- User preferences

### Value Objects
Immutable, self-contained values:
- Money/Currency amounts
- Timestamps and dates
- Addresses and identifiers
- Percentages and ratios

### Integration Contracts
External system interfaces:
- API request/response formats
- Event payload structures
- Error response formats
- Status codes and enums

### Metadata Structures
Supporting information:
- Audit trails
- Timestamps
- Source attribution
- Version information

## Versioning Strategy

### Semantic Versioning
- **Major**: Breaking changes
- **Minor**: New features, backward compatible
- **Patch**: Bug fixes, no API changes

### Compatibility Rules
1. **Addition**: New optional fields allowed
2. **Deprecation**: Mark obsolete with timeline
3. **Removal**: Only in major versions
4. **Modification**: Never change existing fields

### Migration Support
- Migration guides for breaking changes
- Codemods for automated updates
- Compatibility layers during transition
- Clear deprecation warnings

## Quality Attributes

### Consistency
- Same concept, same structure everywhere
- No duplicate definitions
- Single source of truth
- Clear ownership

### Completeness
- All necessary fields included
- Proper documentation
- Validation rules defined
- Examples provided

### Clarity
- Self-documenting names
- Clear type definitions
- Unambiguous semantics
- Good defaults

### Extensibility
- Room for growth
- Extension points identified
- Plugin patterns supported
- Future-proof design

## Documentation Standards

### Field Documentation
Every field must include:
- Purpose and usage
- Type and constraints
- Example values
- Relationships to other fields

### Model Documentation
Every model must include:
- Business purpose
- Usage contexts
- Validation rules
- Example instances

### Change Documentation
Every change must include:
- Reason for change
- Migration instructions
- Impact analysis
- Timeline for deprecation

## Testing Requirements

### Validation Testing
- Field validator tests
- Constraint enforcement
- Edge cases coverage
- Invalid data rejection

### Compatibility Testing
- Cross-version compatibility
- Serialization/deserialization
- Schema validation
- Contract tests

### Documentation Testing
- Example accuracy
- Documentation completeness
- Link validity
- Code sample correctness

## Dependencies

### No External Dependencies
The contract domain has zero runtime dependencies:
- Self-contained
- No external libraries for core functions
- Pure TypeScript types
- Minimal tooling requirements

### Depended Upon By
All other domains depend on contracts:
- Integration Domain
- Portfolio Domain
- Experience Domain

## Governance

### Change Control
- All changes require review
- Breaking changes need approval
- Documentation mandatory
- Versioning enforced

### Ownership
- Shared ownership model
- Architecture team oversight
- Domain teams propose changes
- Consensus-based decisions

### Review Process
1. Proposal with justification
2. Impact analysis
3. Team review and feedback
4. Implementation with tests
5. Documentation update
6. Version release

### Architecture Reviews

The Contract Domain undergoes periodic architectural reviews to ensure alignment with enterprise principles and maintain foundational integrity. Historical reviews are preserved for architectural transparency and decision traceability:

- **[Architecture Reviews Archive](./architecture-reviews/)** - Contains completed architectural assessments and responses
  - System Architect responses to domain reviews
  - Domain Architect assessments and guidance
  - Architectural decision rationale and evolution

These reviews document critical decisions including governance frameworks, documentation philosophy (JSDoc as contract), stability tiers, and versioning strategies.

## Best Practices

### Design Guidelines
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use discriminated unions for variants
- Make illegal states unrepresentable
- Provide sensible defaults

### Naming Conventions
- Clear, descriptive names
- Consistent patterns
- Domain terminology
- Avoid abbreviations

### Type Design
- Prefer specific types over primitives
- Use branded types for identifiers
- Leverage literal types
- Utilize template literal types

## Future Considerations

### Planned Enhancements
- GraphQL schema generation
- OpenAPI specification
- Protocol buffer definitions
- JSON Schema validation

### Evolution Strategy
- Gradual migration paths
- Feature flags for transitions
- A/B testing capabilities
- Progressive enhancement

## Implementation Notes

### Technology Choices
- TypeScript for type safety
- JSON for serialization
- ISO standards for formats
- UTF-8 for text encoding

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient serialization
- Minimal memory footprint
- Fast validation
- Lazy loading support
